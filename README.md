## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

In this first project where I used the Tailwind CSS framework in conjunction with React, I found it to be very good and I would like to continue delving into these technologies for future projects. I also want to use more Tailwind resources, such as its code for dark-light themes, in other works.
